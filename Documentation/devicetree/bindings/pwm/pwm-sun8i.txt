Allwinner sun8i R40/V40/T3 SoC PWM controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of:
    - "allwinner,sun8i-r40-pwm"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - interrupts: Should contain interrupt.
  - clocks: From common clock binding, handle to the parent clock.
  - clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above.
  - pwm-channels: PWM channels of the controller.
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format.

Example:

pwm: pwm@1c23400 {
	     compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-r40-pwm";
	     reg = <0x01c23400 0x400>;
	     interrupts = <GIC_SPI 47 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	     clocks = <&osc24M>, <&ccu CLK_APB1>;
	     clock-names = "mux-0", "mux-1";
	     pwm-channels = <8>;
	     #pwm-cells = <3>;
};
