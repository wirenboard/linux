Wiren Board Embedded Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "wirenboard,wbec"

Optional properties:
- wakeup-source:  Set for ability to power off and wakeup with alarm
- gpio-controller:  Register GPIO driver
- ngpios:  Number of used GPIOs (from common GPIO bindings)
- gpio-line-names:  GPIO names (from common GPIO bindings)


Example:
	wbec: wbec@0 {
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;

		compatible = "wirenboard,wbec";
		reg = <0>;
		status = "okay";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		wakeup-source;

		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		ngpios = <6>;
		gpio-line-names = "EC A1", "EC A2", "EC A3", "EC A4", "EC V OUT", "EC WBMZ STATUS";
	};
