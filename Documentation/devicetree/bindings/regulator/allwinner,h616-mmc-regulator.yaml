title: Allwinner H616 MMC Regulator

maintainers:

description: |
  This driver supports the built-in MMC voltage regulator of the 
  Allwinner H616 processor, which allows switching voltage levels 
  on data lines without using any external regulators. 
  The regulator is required to switch the voltage from 3.3V to 1.8V 
  on the data lines to support high-speed SD-UHS modes for MicroSD.
  Without the regulator, the MicroSD will operate only in slow-modes.
